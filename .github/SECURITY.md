## SECURITY POLICY

This document outlines the security considerations for the Robotic Control Algorithm project.

**General security principles:**

* **Secure coding practices:** We strive to follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced into the codebase. This includes avoiding common pitfalls like buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).
* **Regular updates:** We recommend keeping the project dependencies up-to-date to address any known security vulnerabilities in external libraries.
* **Input validation:** User input is validated to prevent malicious code injection or unexpected behavior.
* **Error handling:** Errors are handled gracefully to prevent information disclosure or system crashes.

**Specific considerations for this project:**

* This project is currently designed for educational purposes and is not intended for deployment in a production environment.
* If deploying this project in a production environment, additional security measures may be necessary, such as:
    * **Authentication and authorization:** Implement mechanisms to control access to the user interface and prevent unauthorized use of the functionalities.
    * **Network security:** Secure any network communication channels to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
    * **Regular security assessments:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

**Reporting security vulnerabilities:**

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

1. **Contact the project maintainers:** Please contact the project maintainers privately through email or a dedicated channel for reporting security vulnerabilities.
2. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly:** Avoid publicly disclosing the vulnerability before it has been addressed to prevent attackers from exploiting it.
3. **Provide sufficient information:** When reporting the vulnerability, provide enough information for the maintainers to understand the nature of the issue and reproduce it.

We appreciate your help in keeping this project secure.
